## My Digital CV

My contents (education, etc.)

## __Profile__ 

My name is Kamonnun Silarat. My nickname is Baitong. Now I'm in Grade 12 and I haven't experience at Digital Marketing yet. 
However, I learned some of their skills in economy subject at school but not familiar with it. I've dreamed to be a developer someday 
but not certainly sure about the future. Major occupation dreams are to be an AI engineer and programmer. 
I want to learn more and skill in each part and familiar with programing lessons.
